1.Start thread by extending thread and override the run method
2.Start thread by implementing runnable interface and override the run method.

Thread Life Cycle:

1. New - A thread is in this state when it is created but not yet started.
2. Runnable - After the start method is called, the thread becomes runnable.
   It's ready to run and is waiting for CPU time.
3. Running - The thread is in this state when it is executing.
4. Blocked/Waiting - A thread is in this state when it is waiting for a
   resource or for another thread to perform an action.
5. Terminated - A thread is in state when it has finished executing.
